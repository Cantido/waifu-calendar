You can also generate a `*.ics` file with the next year's worth of birthdays,
compatible with Google Calendar, iCal, Thunderbird, or probably whatever other calendar you use.

```console
$ waifucal ics -o birthdays.ics Owldown
```

For all commands and options, use the `help` command.

```console
$ waifu-calendar help
```

### As an HTTP Server

This project defines a server executable that presents a simple HTTP interface to access ths functionality.
To install it, enable the `http` feature when you install this tool:

```console
$ cargo install waifu-calendar --features http
```

Then run it with the name `waifu-server`

```console
$ waifu-server
```

The server will then be accessible at <http://localhost:8080>.

### As a library

If you just wish to use this project as a library, disable all default features:

```console
$ cargo add waifu-calendar --no-default-features
```

The `ics` feature for generating ICalendar files is also a default feature,
so add that feature back if you need it.
